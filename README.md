# freezeframebot
*record scratch* *freeze frame* Yep, that's me. I'm a twitter bot that takes random youtube videos and makes them into this meme.

Because I'm a shitty developer, you have to download the libraries on your own.

You'll need:
* ffmpeg
* moviepy
* pytube
* twython
* beautifulsoup (bf4)
